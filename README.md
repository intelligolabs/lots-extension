This is the official implementation of the **LOTS** adapter from the paper *"Multi-Level Conditioning by Pairing Localized Text and Sketch for Fashion Image Generation"*. The paper is currently under review.

To access the **Sketchy** dataset, refer to [the HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/federicogirella/sketchy)

## Road Map ##

- [x] Code release
- [x] Weights release
- [ ] Platform release

## Repository Structure ##
1. `ckpts` folder
* Contains the pre-trained weights of the LOTS adapter.

2. `scripts` folder
* Contains all the scripts for training and inference with LOTS on Sketchy.

3. `src` folder
* Contains all the source code for the classes, models, and dataloaders used in the scripts.

## Installation ##

We advise creating a Conda environment as follows
* `conda create -n lots python=3.12`
* `conda activate lots`
* `pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `pip install -e .`

Unzip the pre-trained weights and config
```
cd ckpts
unzip lots.zip
cd ..
```


## **Training** ##
We provide the script to train LOTS on our Sketchy dataset in `scripts/lots/train_lots.py`.
For an example of usage, check `run_train.sh`, which contains the default parameters used in our experiments.

## **Inference** ##
You can test our pre-trained model with the inference script in `scripts/lots/inference_lots.py`.
For an example, check `run_inference.sh`.
This script generates an image for each item in the test split of Sketchy, and saves them in a structured folder, with each item identified by its unique ID.
